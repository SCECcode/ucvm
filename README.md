# UCVM

## Current UCVM Software Release
The current UCVM software version is [UCVM v21.10.0](http://github.com/SCECcode/ucvm/wiki) which was released in October 2021. We recommend that new users work with this version of the software because it contains improvements not found in earlier versions.

Since UCVM v19.4.0 was released, we have continued to integrate new velocity models and new capabilities into UCVM. These recent changes are available on a UCVM development branch in this github repository, but these updates have not been included in an official UCVM release. To simplify UCVM software development, we are separating the next UCVM software distribution into a collection of inter-operable software packages. This is the UCVM github repository for the [UCVM core package](https://github.com/SCECcode/ucvm.git) that provides the UCVM query interface. The velocity models are managed in their own github repositories (e.g. [CVM-S4](https://github.com/SCECcode/cvms), [CVM-H v15.1](https://github.com/SCECcode/cvmh), [CVM-S4.26](https://github.com/SCECcode/cvms5), [CVM-S4.26.M01](https://github.com/SCECcode/cvmsi)). Specialized UCVM plotting tools can be retrieved from the [UCVM plotting package](https://github.com/SCECcode/ucvm_plotting) github repository if needed. We expect to release this multi-package version of UCVM in mid-2021.

UCVM is distributed as open-source scientific software. It can be installed compiled and run on most Linux-based computer systems if the system includes software development tools including Python, C, and Fortran compilers, and other software tools.

## Background

The SCEC Unified Community Velocity Model (UCVM) software is used to access information, including estimated Vp and Vs seismic wave velocities and density, about the earth's crust. 

UCVM provides seismic velocity information for several California regions. Seismic velocities of rocks and sediments at shallow depths determine how strongly an area will shake. By assigning velocities to rock types in the 3-D geologic model, geologists can gain an understanding of the extent of areas of low shear velocity that are most likely to experience localized strong shaking and future earthquake damage. An important application for the models accessible through UCVM is for use in computer simulations of California earthquakes.

The Unified Community Velocity Model (UCVM) software framework is a collection of software tools designed to provide a standard interface to multiple, alternative, California velocity models. UCVM development is an interdisciplinary research collaboration involving geoscientists, computer scientists, and software developers. UCVM is used in high resolution 3D wave propagation simulations for California. 

The map below shows the coverage regions for currently supported California velocity models that are accessible through UCVM. Each of the models shown is considered a regional velocity model. Typically the models return values down to about 50km or 100km, but most models are undefined below 100km. For earth material properties below 100km, global seismic velocity models, such as the Preliminary Earth Reference Model (PREM), are possible alternative models.

UCVM software repository contains a software codebase developed by Philip Maechling, Mei-Hui Su, David Gill, Patrick Small, and others at SCEC. UCVM is released as open-source scientific software under an Apache 2 software license.

UCVM was developed with support from National Science Foundation (NSF), US Geological Survey (USGS), and other sources.


## System and Software Requirements

Testing UCVM on all possible combinations of operating sysetms and software stacks requires more software developer resources than currently available. So, we have defined a UCVM reference software stack that we use to develop and test the software. This UCVM distrbution has been shown to work on the following reference software stack. It may work on other software stacks, also, but this is the supported software environment.

*  Linux operating system (e.g. CentOS 7 Linux) x86_64-linux 
*  GNU gcc/gfortran compilers version 4.8.5
*  Python 2 or 3 (Anaconda)
*  Autotools build software for Linux
*  Automake, Autoconf build tools for Linux
*  Git client

External Libraries installed by UCVM

*  Euclid Etree library: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~euclid/ (provided during installation)
*  Proj.5 projection library: http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/ (provided during installation)

Optional Software for building MPI binaries:

*  openmpi 1.8.8??

## Installation
Once the target computer has the required software tools installed, the basic install of UCVM is:
*  git clone https://github.com/SCECcode/UCVM.git
*  cd UCVM/largefiles
*  ./get_large_files.py
*  ./check_largefiles_md5.py
*  ./stage_large_files.py
*  cd ..
*  ./ucvm_setup.py

The get_large_files.py and ucvm_setup.py scripts run in a terminal window and print text questions to the user.  The user types answers to the questions in the terminal window. The retrieval script asks the user which velocity model they would like to stage into the local system and the install script asks the user which velocity models they would like to install from retrieved model list: ( 
CVM-H v15.1, CVM-S4, CVM-S4.26, CVM-S4.26.M01, CCA06, CS17.3, CS17.3-H, Albacore, IVLSU, CVLSU, WFCVM, and USGS CenCal). 
Several models are very large. CCA06, CS17.3 and CS17.3-H are 9.2G, 72G and 72G respectively. We recommend that the user only retrieve needed models and install all retrieved models.

The script will then automatically compile, build, and install the selected models.

Important! Do not move the UCVM installation to a place different from the target location specified during build time. This will render the autogenerated ucvm.conf and ucvm_bash.conf with useless paths.

## MPI Compilers and UCVM Programs

If a GNU-based MPI compiler is detected, the MPI version of several utilities are created, including ucvm2mesh_mpi, ucvm2mesh_mpi_layer, ucvm2etree_mpi, and basin_query_mpi are built. Otherwise, only the serial versions for these programs are built.

## Configuration
The main UCVM configuration file is ${UCVM_INSTALL_DIR}/conf/ucvm.conf. 
This file defines the paths to some configured models and maps, and it defines selected model flags, such as CVM-H USE_GTL. The UCVM installer sets up this ucvm.conf file automatically.

In most cases, the user does not need to edit the UCVM/conf/ucvm.conf. However, in some circumstances, such as changing the behavior of the CVM-H model, the user  might want to edit the ucvm.conf file. Please see the User Guide for more details on how to edit the UCVM/conf/ucvm.conf configuration file.

## Standard Models and Maps
The following California velocity models packages are included as part of a standard UCVM installation.  Each model is assigned an abbreviation, and these abbreviations are used to specify the models when making UCVM queries. The model abbreviations used by UCVM are defined in following tables:
